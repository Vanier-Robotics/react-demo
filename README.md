## Prompt
You are given a barebones React project, a mockup and a technical sheet. 

Your job is to:
1. Recreate the mockup as authentically as possible (should be identical)
    * Try to use flexbox in your CSS as much as possible 
    * Avoid absolute positioning or use of margin for positioning
    * Use components! Create at least a component for the buttons
2. Implement the stopwatch functionality (Advanced)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
